pingtracker -- A perl based ping tracker
===========

A pretty simple script that simply takes your ping times against www.google.com and puts those values
in a text file separated by newlines.  I generally use this when I'm experiencing what I perceive to be
inconsistent speeds in my connection and want to have something keep track of those times for me while
I'm doing other things




TO DO:
- Add parameter to change host that pings go against
- Add parameters for a length of time or number of ping requests (or both)
- Add parameter for output filename
- Add functionality to create a primitive graphical representation of ping variance based on values in a given file (preferably   a file created by this script)
